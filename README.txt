Privacy-first web analytics. Simple & fast real-time website analytics that belong to you.

== Description ==

nilly offers privacy-first web analytics because we think you should be in full control of your data.

With nilly, you can have all the benefits from learning about your website visitors without sacrificing your and your visitors privacy. You do not have to implement any annoying cookie notices and/or consent banners and you get all the information you need in a simple yet informative dashboard.

This plugin adds the nilly code automatically to the footer. You can choose your preferred server location and set it to Switzerland or Germany.

You need to have a [nilly](http://nilly.io "Privacy-first web analytics") account for the analytics to work. No registration is needed within the Wordpress plugin
